# zoomcamp-faq-chatbot
This project follows and reproduces the work from the LLM-RAG Workshop to create a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). The chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) based on documents from the DataTalksClub Zoomcamp.
