# LLM-RAG Chatbot for DataTalksClub Zoomcamp FAQ
This project follows and reproduces the work from the [LLM-RAG Workshop](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/llm-rag-workshop/tree/main) to create a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). The chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) based on documents from the DataTalksClub Zoomcamp.
